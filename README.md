# Note-Taker

## Description

This project is a logo maker. When the user opens this project on a command-line application, they will be asked a series of questions. The questions include mostly input based questions and one list type question. The user's input will then be taken and used to create a logo with the same text, text color, shape, and shape color that the user selected. This project contains notes on index.js and all the files within the lib folder.

## Installation

The user will first be required to have a command-line application downloaded onto their computer or laptop. The user must also have node.js installed onto that device. Once they have these two downloaded, the user could type "npm i" into their terminal or window. Once this is finished being installed, the user can type in "node index.js" to be asked the series of questions to create their own logo.

## Usage

One the user has node.js installed into their computer or laptop, they could open their terminal or window and process to type in "node index.js" as mentioned above. The command-line application the user is using will then process to ask input questions. The user will be asked to input three characters that will be displayed on their logo. An error message will be shown if the user tries to input a text that is shorter than three characters. They will then be asked to choose a text color and shape color. The user could input a color or a hexidecimal number for these answers. The user will also be asked on list question asking them to choose a shape from the list of triangle, square, and circle. One the questions are all answered, a logo.svg file will be created within the examples folder. When the user opens this file on a browser, their logo will be shown in a 300 by 200 pixel image.
