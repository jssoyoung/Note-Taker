# Note-Taker

## Description

This project is created to store all the user's notes. The user could click the get started button in order to create a note. The user will be asked to create a title for the note and add in text for the note. Once a note is written with the text and title, a save button appears on the top right corner. If clicked, the note will be stored and added to the left side column. The user could click on the notes on the left column for their full note to show up. If the plus sign on the right top corner is clicked, it will go back to creating a new note. This project contains notes on apiRoutes.js and index.js.

## Installation

The user will first be required to have a command-line application downloaded onto their computer or laptop. The user must also have node.js installed onto that device. Once they have these two downloaded, the user could type "npm i" into their terminal or window. Once this is finished being installed, the user can type in "node server.js" to be given the PORT the user could go to in order to see this project.

## Usage

One the user has node.js installed into their computer or laptop, they could open their terminal or window and process to type in "npm i" to download the dependencies and then type in "node server.js" as mentioned above. The command-line application the user is using will then say "App listening at http://localhost:3001 ðŸš€". If the user opens this link in a browser, the project will show the index.html screen. The user could then click the get started button. Once clicked, the notes.html screen will show. The user could write in a note onto the screen. The user will be required to type in a title and text of a note in order for the save button to appear on the top right corner. Once saved, the note will be added to the list on the left side. The user could click on any notes on the left side and their saved note will be shown on the right hand column. The user could also click on the plus sign button on the top right corner to go back to adding a new note. Even when refreshed, the notes will continue to stay on the left side column.
